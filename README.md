## How to run it in your PC locally

- `git clone https://github.com/skavvathas/to-do-list.git`
- Download the Mac or Windows installer from the Nodes.jsÂ® web site (if you haven't), because we want the Node.js environment.
- Install the MongoDB database in your PC locally, and the MongoDB shell to see your collections.
- Go inside the folder of the project and open a terminal. 
- Type in your terminal `node app.js`. Now go to http://localhost:3000/ and the web application run locally.
- From the Mongo shell you can see the collections.
